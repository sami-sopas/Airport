# Airport

Console project coded in C++ that simulates the process of a passenger at an airport when taking a flight

For this project the "Queues and Stacks" data structures were mainly used.

Thanks to the object-oriented approach, it was easy to transmit information from one data structure to another without losing data integrity.

## Extra
- The main menu is controlled with the keyboard arrows (UP & DOWN) and ENTER
- The animations use the windows.h library so if you don't use windows you may get an error
- The data structures are made with templates so you can change the objects if necessary
